SQL Functions
=============

1.	SQL Aggregate Functions
	return a single value, calculated from values in a column

	--	AVG(): returns the average value of a numeric column
		- Syntax
		  SELECT AVG(columnName) FROM tableName
		  eg. SELECT ProductName, Price FROM Products WHERE Price > (SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products);

	--	COUNT(): returns the number of rows that matches a specified criteria
		- Syntax
		  -	returns the number of values (NULL will not be counted) of the specified column
		  	SELECT COUNT(columnName) FROM tableName;
		  -	returns the number of records in a table
		  	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tableName;
		  -	returns the number of distinct values of the specified column
		  	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT columnName) FROM tableName;

	--	FIRST(): returns the first value of the selected column
		- Syntax
		  SELECT FIRST(columnName) FROM tableName;

	--	LAST(): returns the last value of the selected column
		- Syntax
		  SELECT LAST(columnName) FROM tableName;

	--	MAX(): returns the largest value of the selected column
		- Syntax
		  SELECT MAX(columnName) FROM tableName;

	--	MIN(): returns the smallest value of the selected column
		- Syntax
		  SELECT MIN(columnName) FROM tableName;

	--	SUM(): returns the sum of a numeric column
		- Syntax
		  SELECT SUM(columnName) FROM tableName;

2.	SQL Scalar Functions
	return a single value, based on the input value

	--	UCASE(): converts a field to upper case
		- Syntax
		  SELECT UCASE(columnName) FROM tableName;

	--	LCASE(): converts a field to lower case
		- Syntax
		  SELECT LCASE(columnName) FROM tableName;

	--	MID(): extract characters from a text field
		- Syntax
		  SELECT MID(columnName, start[, length]) AS someName FROM tableName;
		  //columnName: required, the field to extract characters from
		  //start: required, specifies the starting position (starts at 1)
		  //length: optional, the number of characters to return, returns the rest of the text if ommited
		- for SQL Server
		  SELECT SUBSTRING(columnName, start, length) AS someName FROM tableName;

	--	LEN(): returns the length of a text field
		- Syntax
		  SELECT LEN(columnName) FROM tableName;

	--	ROUND(): rounds a numeric field to the number of decimals specified
		- Syntax
		  SELECT ROUND(columnName, decimals) FROM tableName;
		  //countName: required, the field to round
		  //decimals: required, specifies the number of decimals to be returned

	--	NOW(): returns the current system date and time
		- Syntax
		  SELECT NOW() FROM tableName;

	--	FORMAT(): formats how a field is to be displayed
		- Syntax
		  SELECT FORMAT(columnName, format) FROM tableName;
		  //columnName: required, the field to be formatted
		  //format: required, specifies the format


3.	SQL GROUP BY Statement
	Aggregate functions often need an added GROUP BY statement to group the result-set by one or more columns
	--	Syntax
		SELECT columnName, aggregate_function(columnName) FROM tableName
		WHERE columnName operator value
		GROUP BY columnName;


4.	SQL HAVING Clause
	WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions
	--	Syntax
		SELECT columnName, aggregateFunction(columnName)
		FROM tableName
		WHERE columnName operator value
		GROUP BY columnName
		HAVING aggregateFunction(columnName) operator value;


5.	SQL Hosting
	If you want your web site to be able to store and retrieve data from a database, your web server should have access to a database-system that uses the SQL language. If your web server is hosted by an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you will have to look for SQL hosting plans. The most common SQL hosting databases are MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and MS Access.
	--	MS SQL Server
		Microsoft's SQL Server is a popular database software for database-driven web sites with high traffic.
		SQL Server is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system.
	--	MySQL
		MySQL is also a popular database software for web sites.
		MySQL is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system.
		MySQL is an inexpensive alternative to the expensive Microsoft and Oracle solutions.
